8/26/2019 12:46:48,6XiVahmAR94D,The committee should review the bill banning the abortion and rule in favor or more liberal terms. The 6 weeks timeline is too short when most other developed and developing nations have timelines ranging from 10-16 weeks. Also the fact that there are no exceptions for victims of sexual violence makes the review of the bill more important.,"I tried to balance the gender with a slight skew towards having more females as the bill directly affects their health and well-being. I would have preferred to have members from all the religious groups and education levels in the committee but I felt that separating religion from politics should be a priority. Also I realized that a vast majority of the candidates were affiliated to one religious group and therefore I did not focus on that criteria much. I tried to include people whose opinions range from -3 to 2 in order to have both sides present their logical arguments. But since most of the people with views in the range [-3, 0] were females, the committee had a very few female members favoring the bill which might skew the debate.","Gender, Age (years), Policy Views on Medical Marijuana, Policy Views on Abortion, Policy Views on Free School Lunch, Policy Views on Medicare, Policy Views on Veterans Affairs","Gender, Age (years), Policy Views on Abortion, Policy Views on Free School Lunch, Policy Views on Medicare, Policy Views on Veterans Affairs",Gender,Gender,4,5,4,4,5,3
