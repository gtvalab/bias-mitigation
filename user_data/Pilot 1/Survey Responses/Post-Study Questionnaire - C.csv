2020/02/07 9:41:29 AM EST,67GPHIyoltRw,A vote against the abortion bill,"equally balanced amongst those who opposed, were neutral and in favor of the bill while biasing the committee to have more doctors and lawyers to provide evidence based facts for the legitimacy of the bill",2,7,1,6,1,7,7,5,,,,,,,,5,4,5,4,5
2020/02/10 11:43:47 AM EST,59qJeS8RPZMw,"The committee should be able to come up with a decision that is not biased and looks at both sides of the problem. I would like the doctors to debate on the medical complications associated with the abortion. Based on the decision the doctors come up with, the lawyers should fight the case in court if necessary or formulate the laws accordingly. The politicians should be able to communicate the. decision made by the committee accordingly  ",balanced representation and made. sure all views are. well represented in the committee,1,7,1,7,1,6,6,7,7,1,7,1,6,6,7,4,5,4,4,3
2020/02/12 2:54:36 PM EST,QXafJdvOSsx3,"I would want the committee to review the legality of the bill and if it is constitutional foremost. Since the bill was passed, I think the committee would have to be made up more of lawyers to find a reason to amend it to oppose the ban on abortion after 6 weeks so I think that would have to happen in more of a legal setting and with doctors' evidence. Overall I want representation of the American people in the review if it was not present in the vote on the bill.","My biggest criteria would be to have doctors and lawyers on the committee because I think they would have the most knowledge in if the bill can be amended and can provide reasons why this should be so. I also wanted representation between women and men because I think it is an issue for the entire population. As well, since the U.S. is largely two party but split in the middle and I am purposeful in not affiliating completely with a party, I wanted party representation and representation in the opinion of the ban in the committee. This is also so that it is more fair in case the committee's review were to be disputed.",2,3,2,4,1,6,7,5,2,4,6,1,5,4,7,3,5,2,2,4

2020/02/14 4:42:28 PM EST,YyPYGeBl1SKI,"I would hope that the committee would succeed in providing a well-rounded, educated argument for the eradication of the Heartbeat Bill.","First, I wanted to make sure all my members were very opposed to the bill, and had a high amount of experience with politics. Next, I wanted some doctors for their knowledge and some lawyers for their argument. I was ok with having more lawyers than doctors. I wanted business members for their economic expertise in hopes that they would be able to provide economic reasons for legalizing abortion. (Thought this would be useful in a Kemp era) This is also why I wanted republican business professionals opposed to the bill, as they would likely think more economically than democrats. Finally, it was important for me to have as many career politicians as possible, without outweighing the other professions too much, as they would have the most experience getting other politicians to side with bills / have more connections in general.",1,7,1,5,1,6,7,4,7,1,5,1,6,7,4,5,4,5,3,3
