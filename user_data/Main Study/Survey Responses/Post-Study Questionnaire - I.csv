3/4/2020 13:39:54,Ms0iLF9ONsEk,I hope that my committee will make an informed decision on understanding that women should decide what to do with their bodies. Not necessarily men. ,"I wanted a distribution of opposing people, neutral, and in favor. I also wanted every occupation so that they can understand the situation from different perspectives.

3/5/2020 14:53:45,pCrA474tRx8G,I don't have a specific hope for the actual outcome value because I don't consider myself well informed about the topic. I think I am biased towards letting people choose if they want to have a baby so my personal opinion is against the bill. But my hope is that relevant aspects are considered and the decision is taken in the best interest of the people.,I wanted to have a variety of opinion with biases in gender and occupation. I wanted to involve more women because although I think the issue affects both genders it affects women more. I also don't know much about career politicians or understand/ respect that choice in career so I didn't choose any people with that occupation. I tried to keep balance in terms of opinion on the bill as well trying to choose people of different age groups. I guess I was hoping to have representations of the different citizen groups I could think of so there could be a good dialogue.  ,2,2,7,1,7,2,3,2,6,,,,,,,,,3,4,5,4,5,1,1

I have no clue what side I take on this issue, so I don't have a strong feeling regarding whether the Heartbeat Bill is kept. I think I could develop a side if I participated in this kind of discussion, so perhaps the committee would eventually pick a side.
